# Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Run the server following command:
```bash
1. npm install
2. npm start

# Todo

This project supports <strong>multi-language</strong> website - LTR & RTL. I strive for <strong>pixel-perfect</strong> and <strong>responsiveness</strong> of the website.
